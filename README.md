# Data Analytics Projects by Lasse Narinen

Hey there!

<br/>

Glad you found your way in here. This is my portfolio for showcasing my personal projects related to data analytics.

In its current state this repository includes my projects working with survey data related to a career survey of data professionals. You can find more details about the used data [below](#dataset-info).

In the first project I perform data cleaning using SQL, where I prepare data from the survey for further analysis and visualizations. Do check it out in the directory called [Data Cleaning in SQL - Data Professional Survey](https://github.com/delissious/dps/tree/main/Data%20Cleaning%20in%20SQL%20-%20Data%20Professional%20Survey)!

Further upcoming projects include exploratory data analysis on the cleaned survey data using SQL and a data visualization project with Power BI.

I hope you appreciate the projects. Let me know if you have any comments or notes about my work!

Thanks for stopping by!
<br/>
<br/>

_Sincerely_

_Lasse_

### About the Data

The data used in the projects is from a real survey conducted in 2022 by Alex Freberg also known as Alex the Analyst. You can find more about him from his website [here](https://www.alextheanalyst.com/about). The survey was targeted for data professionals regarding the state and perspectives on their careers.

The dataset can be found in Alex's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx).
